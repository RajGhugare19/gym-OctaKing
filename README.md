# OctaKing
This is a custom made OpenAI gym environment I've made for a boardgame I invented. 

## Rules
1) Each player will start the game with four kings on a 4 cross 4 board, with the black and white kings on the fourth and the first respectively.
2) Kings can move the same way they do in chess, excpet they cannot take a move in the backward direction, i.e of the 8 cardinal and inter-cardinal directions, the king can move only in five.The following image shows all legal moves for a king.

3) If there is a black king on any of these marked squares then the white king can capture it and vice versa.
4)
